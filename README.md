# Classtab UI

A lightweight, static web interface for browsing and playing classical guitar tablature from the [Classtab](https://classtab.com) website.

## What is this?

The original Classtab site hosts a large collection of guitar tablature in a single, monolithic HTML page.  This repository contains a **cleaned‑up, split‑up** version of that data and a small front‑end that:

* Lists songs grouped by author.
* Allows quick filtering by author, difficulty, video availability, and bookmarks.
* Shows a table with columns for **Author**, **Title**, **Easy**, **LHF**, **MIDI**, and **Video**.
* Opens the corresponding `.txt` tablature file in a side‑panel when a title is clicked.

The UI is built with plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript – no build step or dependencies are required.

## Getting started

The repository contains two compressed archives:

* `tabs.zip` – contains all the `.txt` tablature files.
* `midi.zip` – contains all the `.mid` MIDI files.

### 1. Unzip the archives

```bash
unzip tabs.zip   # creates a folder called `tabs`
unzip midi.zip   # creates a folder called `midi`
```

Both folders should be placed in the root of the repository.

### 2. Serve the site locally

The simplest way to view the UI is to run a local HTTP server.  Two common options are shown below.

#### Python 3 (recommended)

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/index4.html`.

#### Node.js (http-server)

If you have Node.js installed you can use the `http-server` package:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```

Again, visit `http://localhost:8000/index4.html`.

### 3. Using the UI

* **Author filter** – type an author’s name (or part of it) into the text box.
* **Easy / Video** – toggle the checkboxes to show only easy songs or songs that have a YouTube video.
* **Bookmarks** – click the star icon next to a song to bookmark it.  Bookmarks are stored in `localStorage` and persist across page reloads.
* **Tabs panel** – click a song title to load the corresponding `.txt` file in the right‑hand panel.

## How the data was generated

1. **Download the original Classtab page** – the raw HTML was saved locally.
2. **Split the page** – `py_split_authors.py` parsed the HTML and created a set of files in the `songs_html_chunks` directory (each ~500 lines of code).  These files are not committed to the repo.
3. **Process with LLM** – `py_process_all_llm.py` ran a language‑model pipeline on the chunks, producing `songs_json` and `songs_data_raw.js`.
4. **Clean up** – `py_clean_songs.py` cleaned author and title fields, producing `songs_data.js`, which is used by `index4.html`.
5. **Manual tweaks** – the UI was built and the file renamed to `index4.html`.

Feel free to explore the scripts if you want to regenerate the data or adapt the pipeline for other sources.
